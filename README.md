Quick project to find words in the English language that are ordered sequentially in alphabetical order.
This came from discovering that my name, Aditya, is almost alphabetically sequential. From a 355k list of words, ive only found a couple that are interesting. Most notably adios,below, and ghost. Feel free to try it out on your own, it takes one argumentfor the minimum number of letters you want the word to be. 
For example, "python3 wordchecker.py 3" wont return ab but will return abs. All words are written to a textfile called "finalList.txt"

Below are some examples I came up with
