Quick project to find words in the English language that are ordered sequentially in alphabetical order.
This came from discovering that my name, Aditya, is almost alphabetically sequential. From a 355k list of words, ive only
found a couple that are interesting. Most notably adios and ghost. Feel free to try it out on your own, it takes one argument 
for the number of letters you want the word to be

"python3 script.py 3" wont return ab as a result but will return abs
